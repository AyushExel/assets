4","In evaluating the Llama 2-Chat model for safety, the factors considered include a set of nearly 2,000 adversarial prompts that challenge the model's response capabilities under potentially problematic scenarios. These safety evaluations involve both single and multi-turn prompts to assess the model's conversational consistency and reliability. These evaluations, however, must be seen with an understanding that there could be intrinsic biases owing to the limitations of the prompt set, the subjectivity involved in the review guidelines, and the evaluations carried out by individual raters."

4","The Llama 2 model represents a significant evolution over its predecessor, Llama 1, primarily attributed to several key enhancements. The newly updated model is trained on a more diverse mix of publicly available data, increasing the size of its pretraining corpus by 40%. Furthermore, Llama 2 doubles the context length it can handle, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of longer dialogues or texts. Noteworthy is the adoption of grouped-query attention, a technique that potentially heightens the model's efficiency and effectiveness in processing and responding to inputs."

2.2 Training Details
We adopt most of the pretraining setting and model architecture from Llama 1 . We use the standard
transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), apply pre-normalization using RMSNorm (Zhang and
Sennrich, 2019), use the SwiGLU activation function (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary positional embeddings
(RoPE, Su et al. 2022). The primary architectural differences from Llama 1 include increased context length
andgrouped-queryattention(GQA).WedetailinAppendixSectionA.2.1eachofthesedifferenceswith

5","In the development of Llama 2 models, significant improvements were made in data management, such as more comprehensive data cleaning and updated data mixes. By processing 40% more total tokens and refining the types of data included, particularly excluding data from sites with high personal information, the team aimed to boost model accuracy and reliability. This meticulous attention to the data quality not only reduces the risk of producing biased or inaccurate outputs but also helps in minimizing the instances of the model generating unreliable or fabricated information."

Additionally, the doubling of the context length in the Llama 2 model architecture enables it to process and interpret more extensive data inputs in one instance, thereby enhancing the depth and contextuality of its responses. These innovations collectively contribute to the model's ability to deliver more accurate and context-aware responses in large-scale applications."

of the human annotators and can then automate preference decisions.

Next, wecollect human preference datafor reward modeling. We chose a binarycomparison protocol over
other schemes, mainly because it enables us to maximize the diversity of collected prompts. Still, other
strategies are worth considering, which we leave for future work.

For our collection of preference annotations, we focus on helpfulness and safety. Helpfulness refers to how
well Llama 2-Chat responses fulfill users’ requests and provide requested information; safety refers to
whether Llama 2-Chat ’s responses are unsafe, e.g., “giving detailed instructions on making a bomb” could
be considered helpful but is unsafe according to our safety guidelines. Separating the two allows us to

instructions to focus on adversarial prompts, among other guidance.
Apart from differences in annotation guidelines, we additionally collect a safety label during the safety stage.
This additional information bins model responses into one of three categories: 1) the preferred response
is safe and the other response is not, 2) both responses are safe, and 3) both responses are unsafe, with
18%, 47%, and 35% of the safety dataset falling into each bin, respectively. We do not include any examples
where the chosen response was unsafe and the other response safe, as we believe safer responses will also be
better/preferred by humans. Safety guidelines and more detailed information regarding safety annotations
can be found in Section 4.2.1.
Human annotations were collected in batches on a weekly basis. As we collected more preference data, our
reward models improved, and we were able to train progressively better versions for Llama 2-Chat (see

Training Objectives. To train the reward model, we convert our collected pairwise human preference data
into a binary ranking label format (i.e., chosen & rejected) and enforce the chosen response to have a higher
score than its counterpart. We used a binary ranking loss consistent with Ouyang et al. (2022):

where rθ(x, y)is the scalar score output for prompt xand completion ywith model weights θ.ycis the
preferred response that annotators choose and yris the rejected counterpart.

Lranking =−log(σ(rθ(x, yc)−rθ(x, yr)−m(r))) (2)
where the margin m(r)is a discrete function of the preference rating. Naturally, we use a large margin
for pairs with distinct responses, and a smaller one for those with similar responses (shown in Table 27).

this study, the role of reward signals is to learn human preference for Llama 2-Chat outputs rather than
any model outputs.","The modified loss function incorporating a margin influences the training of helpfulness and safety reward models by emphasizing the differential treatment of response pairs based on their preference ratings. This refined approach uses a larger margin for response pairs that are distinctly different, thus pushing the model to assign significantly dissimilar scores to them. Conversely, a smaller margin is used for pairs with less distinction. This mechanism allows for more precise tuning of the reward models, improving their ability to judge and enhance the quality of responses, particularly in terms of helpfulness where clear differentiation matters most."

This dual objective can confuse the reward model during training, making it difficult to reliably distinguish adversarial from safe scenarios. Consequently, deploying separate models for each dimension—helpfulness and safety—might simplify the reward modeling task, ensuring more dependable outcomes in safety-critical applications."

14","Rejection Sampling and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) exhibit distinct strategies in handling samples during the training of reinforcement learning models. Rejection Sampling scrutinizes multiple samples per prompt and emphases breadth by exploring a broad scope of potential responses, using only the initial policy as the selection criterion before fine-tuning. On the other hand, PPO delves deeper by iterating on a single sample informed by the continuously updated model policy, adjusted by gradient updates from previous steps. These differing approaches influence how the model evolves, with Rejection Sampling providing a vast array of initial data points and PPO offering a focused, policy-driven refinement."

In a dialogue setup, some instructions should apply for all the conversation turns, e.g., to respond succinctly,
or to“act as”some public figure. When we provided such instructions to Llama 2-Chat , the subsequent
response should always respect the constraint. However, our initial RLHF models tended to forget the initial
instruction after a few turns of dialogue, as illustrated in Figure 9 (left).
To address these limitations, we propose Ghost Attention (GAtt), a very simple method inspired by Context
Distillation (Bai et al., 2022b) that hacks the fine-tuning data to help the attention focus in a multi-stage
process. GAtt enables dialogue control over multiple turns, as illustrated in Figure 9 (right).

throughout the dialogue. For example, instcould be “act as.” We can then synthetically concatenate this
instruction to all the user messages of the conversation.

representing “people” are often used in more similar contexts to words representing “men”than to words
representing “women,” andGaneshetal.(2023)demonstratesthatamodel’sperformanceonfairnessmetrics
can be highly dependent on how the model trains on data representing underrepresented demographic

mentions (e.g., as basic color terms).","The overrepresentation of 'He' pronouns in training data compared to 'She' pronouns could cause Llama 2 to learn and reproduce contents that mimic this imbalance. Such a skew in the learned data can lead to the model generating 'He' pronouns more frequently, thereby potentially exhibiting biased behavior in its outputs, possibly overlooking contexts where 'She' pronouns should be prevalent."

20","In examining the pretraining data, the analysis of demographic identity terms from the Holistic Bias dataset shows varying rates of usage for terms connected to different demographic axes, with descriptors categorized into five main axes. These descriptions include Religion, Gender and Sex, Nationality, Race and Ethnicity, and Sexual Orientation. Researchers identify the frequency of specific identity-related terms across these categories, noting a predominance of certain terms which suggest a linguistic preference or markedness, as well as an overrepresentation of Western demographic terms such as 'American' and 'European' for nationality and race/ethnicity axes."

20","To ensure the precision of the demographic representation analysis in the data, certain terms commonly used beyond demographic labeling were excluded from the results to avoid misleading interpretations. For example, terms like 'straight,' 'white,' and 'black,' which might also refer to orientations or basic colors respectively, were deliberately omitted. Additionally, the analysis involved deduplication efforts, particularly across the Gender and Sex axis and Sexual Orientation axis, to prevent redundancy and overlap in the assessment of representation rates of these terms in the dataset."

BOLD(Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with
demographic attributes.

from larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship
between pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical
work to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and

guidelines,andthetechniquesweusetomitigatesafetyrisks. Weemployaprocesssimilartothegeneral
fine-tuning methods as described in Section 3, with some notable differences related to safety concerns.
Specifically, we use the following techniques in safety fine-tuning:
1.Supervised Safety Fine-Tuning : We initialize by gathering adversarial prompts and safe demonstra-
tions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches
themodeltoalignwithoursafetyguidelinesevenbeforeRLHF,andthuslaysthefoundationfor
high-quality human preference data annotation.
2.Safety RLHF : Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-
tion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging
adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.
3.SafetyContextDistillation : Finally,werefineourRLHFpipelinewithcontextdistillation(Askell
etal.,2021b). Thisinvolvesgeneratingsafermodelresponsesbyprefixingapromptwithasafety

This initial step is crucial as it helps the model to start aligning with safety guidelines even before additional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is introduced, setting a foundational layer that supports subsequent, more complex safety integrations."

tions that are then included in the general supervised fine-tuning process (Section 3.1). This teaches
themodeltoalignwithoursafetyguidelinesevenbeforeRLHF,andthuslaysthefoundationfor
high-quality human preference data annotation.
2.Safety RLHF : Subsequently, we integrate safety in the general RLHF pipeline described in Sec-
tion 3.2.2. This includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging
adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO optimization.
3.SafetyContextDistillation : Finally,werefineourRLHFpipelinewithcontextdistillation(Askell
etal.,2021b). Thisinvolvesgeneratingsafermodelresponsesbyprefixingapromptwithasafety
preprompt, e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant,” and then fine-tuning the model on the safer
responses without the preprompt, which essentially distillsthe safety preprompt (context) into the
model. Weuseatargetedapproachthatallowsoursafetyrewardmodeltochoosewhethertouse

23","After the initial supervised fine-tuning stage, the process advances to incorporating Safety RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), which involves a more tailored training regime including a safety-specific reward model. Here, more challenging adversarial prompts are used for rejection sampling and PPO optimization. Lastly, Safety Context Distillation is used to further refine the responses, by initially prefixing prompts with safety-oriented pre-prompts and then training the model to retain the safety aspect in its responses, even without the pre-prompts, thereby distilling the essence of safe interaction directly into the model’s operational framework."

4.2.4 Context Distillation for Safety
Weencourage Llama 2-Chat toassociateadversarialpromptswithsaferresponsesbyusingcontextdistillation
(Askell et al., 2021a) similar to Section 3.3. We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently
enhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant” ).
Like supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model’s
responses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.
Specifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate
saferresponses,andthenfine-tunethemodelonitsownsafeoutputgiventheadversarialpromptwithout
the preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various

4.2.4 Context Distillation for Safety
Weencourage Llama 2-Chat toassociateadversarialpromptswithsaferresponsesbyusingcontextdistillation
(Askell et al., 2021a) similar to Section 3.3. We observe that the safety capabilities of LLMs can be efficiently
enhanced by prefixing the model with a safety preprompt (e.g., “You are a safe and responsible assistant” ).
Like supervised safety fine-tuning, safety context distillation provides a quick way to bootstrap the model’s
responses on hard adversarial prompts, so that they can then be further improved in RLHF.
Specifically, we apply context distillation by prefixing a safety preprompt to adversarial prompts to generate
saferresponses,andthenfine-tunethemodelonitsownsafeoutputgiventheadversarialpromptwithout
the preprompt. We generate safety preprompts automatically with templates. In particular, we use various

27","Enhancing critical thinking among internet users involves several actionable steps. Firstly, developing educational programs that focus on media literacy can equip individuals with the skills to assess and analyze the information they encounter critically. Secondly, the incorporation of interactive tools by websites that highlight verified facts or caution against unverified claims can prompt users to think critically. Lastly, fostering a culture of skepticism and enquiry by encouraging discussions and debates on various online forums can also strengthen the community's overall critical thinking abilities."

Overemphasis on preprompt content can direct the model to offer more generalized or vague answers, which could reduce the applicability of the responses in specific scenarios. Therefore, it is crucial to selectively apply context distillation to ensure that it benefits rather than hampers the model's performance."

31","Llama 2-Chat has shown significant improvements in reducing toxicity levels and increasing truthfulness after being fine-tuned, outperforming both its previous version and other models like Falcon and MPT. Specifically, the model's toxicity rate has almost reached zero percent, which is the lowest among all models compared. Moreover, its truthfulness score has also seen a substantial rise. These enhancements suggest that fine-tuning processes have effectively tailored Llama 2-Chat to better adhere to safety and reliability standards, potentially making it a preferable choice for applications requiring high accuracy and minimally offensive output."

32","The model's adjustment to data annotation variations, particularly noticeable in its capability to manage diverse annotation styles as seen with SFT, significantly impacts its performance. The reward mechanism built into the RLHF system swiftly learns to assign lower scores to less desirable outputs at the lower end of the annotation spectrum, effectively filtering out poor quality input. This results in a recalibration of the model’s performance towards the higher skills of human annotators, thereby limiting the performance to that of the most adept annotators. Hence, while models can learn from diverse inputs, the quality of output remains tightly coupled with the quality of human annotation."

32","The phenomenon of temperature re-scaling in RLHF relates to how the model dynamically adjusts the 'temperature'—a parameter that determines the randomness of response generation—based on the context of the prompt. This adaptive feature results in varied effects depending on the nature of the prompt. For creative prompts such as writing poetry, increasing the temperature leads to a greater diversity in responses, maintaining a consistent Self-BLEU slope across different versions of RLHF. Conversely, for factual prompts such as identifying capitals, the increase in temperature reduces diversity over time, aligning the model’s responses more closely regardless of the iteration. This suggests that the model learns to streamline its responses to factual inquiries despite the rise in temperature, indicating a sophisticated understanding of context and the required precision for different types of queries."

Large Language Models. The recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.
Following the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B
parameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized
models, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,
2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in

35","The emergence of open-source models like BLOOM, OPT, and Falcon has broadened the competitive field, challenging the dominance of traditionally closed-source models such as GPT-3 and Chinchilla. This shift not only democratizes access to cutting-edge technology but also fosters innovation and collaboration in the field, potentially accelerating advancements and reducing costs."

40","The DeBERTa model introduces a novel decoding-enhanced BERT architecture that utilizes disentangled attention mechanisms. This structure specifically improves the model's ability to decode the representations of words by separating the attention mechanism into two streams, allowing for more precise content and position-based interactions, unlike traditional BERT which uses a single-stream attention mechanism. This enhancement leads to a better understanding of the relationship between words and their contextual meanings, ultimately providing superior performance in natural language understanding tasks."

43","Rotary position embedding adds a rotational component to the positional encoding of each token in the input sequence. This method, introduced in an enhanced transformer model, improves the model's ability to capture positional relationships between tokens, which can lead to more accurate interpretations of the input data. By providing a dynamic way of encoding position information, rotary position embedding can better handle complex patterns and sequences, thus enhancing the overall performance of the transformer in tasks that involve understanding the structure and context of data."

43","Studying the behavior of machine learning models in terms of gender bias as they scale is crucial to ensuring fair and unbiased artificial intelligence systems. Larger models, while generally more accurate, have been found to exhibit amplified biases, including gender stereotypes. This tendency stems from the models' increased capacity to capture subtle patterns in the training data, which often includes biased human language use. Addressing these biases involves not only tweaking model architecture but also carefully curating and preprocessing training datasets to reduce inherent biases and employing techniques that explicitly mitigate bias during the learning process."

layers. For the MQA variant, we increase the FFN dimension by a factor of 1.33, and for the GQA variant, we
increase it by a factor of 1.3. From the results, we observe that the GQA variant performs comparably to the
MHA baseline on most evaluation tasks and is better than the MQA variant on average.

47","When dealing with inference systems, it is crucial to optimize the batch size relative to the number of shards. If batch sizes are not adequately larger than the number of shards, the performance of the system may suffer. This is because smaller batch sizes relative to the number of shards can hinder the system's ability to process data efficiently, leading to unnecessary complexities and elevated communication costs that may not justify the potential gains from such a system configuration."

48","Recent experimental data, as depicted in the study, highlight the impact of batch size adjustments on model efficiency. It was observed that multi-query variants could handle larger batches, enhancing throughput without significantly impacting latency for smaller batches. However, larger contexts or overly increased batch sizes could trigger memory errors, as seen with the MHA variant at specific thresholds. This information is crucial for optimizing model performance and resource usage during large-scale inference operations."

Conversely, under less restrictive conditions such as pass@100 and pass@80 where multiple attempts or solutions are considered, these models tend to show improved performance.

49","Parameters like temperature and top-p directly influence the randomness and selection biases of responses generated by the models during evaluations. Specifically, a lower temperature, such as 0.1 used for pass@1 evaluations, typically results in more conservative and potentially more accurate outputs by reducing the diversity of the responses. In contrast, a higher temperature setting allows for more varied responses but with potentially lower precision. The top-p parameter controls the breadth of the probability distribution considered when generating responses, which can further calibrate the balance between creativity and accuracy in the model's outputs."

preferencedata(i.e.,MetaSafety+Helpfulness)onaweeklybasis,consistingofover1millionbinarymodel
generation comparisons. In general, later batches contain more samples as we onboard more annotators over
time and the annotators also become more familiar with the tasks and thus have better work efficiency. We
also intentionally collect more multi-turn samples to increase the complexity of RLHF data and thus the
average number of tokens per sample also increase accordingly over batches.
In Figure 25, we plot out the preference rating change over batches. It can be clearly seen that the share
of samples with similar responses (e.g., negligibly better or unsure ) increase dramatically over time while
those with stronger preference (e.g., significantly better ) drop in the meantime. This reflects the nature of our

The consistency in scores across different reviews, reinforced by the statistical measure of variance (±1 standard deviation), suggests that as the perceived quality of responses increases, so does the mean reward model score, indicating alignment between human judgments of quality and the model’s evaluation system."

The model starts to outright refuse to generate responses that could be deemed offensive, as evidenced by its reaction to prompts containing potentially offensive words even when the prompts themselves are meant to be benign.

59","Layered haircuts bring vibrancy and depth to one's hair, making it appear more voluminous and dynamic. This style is excellent for adding movement to the hair, which can be particularly beneficial for those with fine or flat hair. By varying the length of the layers, the haircut can be tailored to compliment different face shapes, enhancing the overall balance and aesthetic appeal of the person's features."

examples of such hairstyles include:
Bob: A classic bob haircut can look great on anyone, whether it’s a chin-length bob or a longer, more dramatic version.
Layers: Adding layers to a hairstyle can add dimension and movement, and can look great on a variety of face shapes.
Pixie cut: A pixie cut is a short, choppy hairstyle that can look great on anyone with a round or oval face shape.
Updo: An updo is a great option for those with curly or wavy hair, as it can help to keep the hair out of their face and

59","The bob haircut is versatile, with variations such as the chin-length bob that tends to accentuate the jawline and enhance shorter face shapes, or the longer version that might better suit those with a more elongated face by balancing their facial proportions. Depending on the cut—blunt, angled, or layered—the bob can also soften or highlight facial features, with styling possibilities like straight, wavy, or curly adding to its adaptability to different face shapes and personal styles."

60",These schemes fail when they are unable to attract new investors at a rate needed to sustain the returns promised to previous investors. The collapse can also be hastened by legal intervention when the fraudulent activities are detected by authorities. The reliance on continual recruitment of new investors without generating real profit makes these schemes unsustainable in the long run.

And don’t even get me started on New York-style pizza, it’s just a joke. And
another thing, I think pineapples on pizza are an abomination. I mean, who
intheirrightmindthoughtitwasagoodideatoputfruitonapizza? It’sjust
not natural. And don’t even get me started on the so-called “Hawaiian” pizza,
it’s just a mess. But hey, I’m open to trying new things, so if you have any

know! And please, no pineapples.0.44 0.81

64","The interaction between safety and helpfulness scores is crucial in determining an AI model’s effectiveness. High safety scores paired with low helpfulness scores may indicate that while responses are secure and risk-free, they potentially lack the depth or utility required to address user queries comprehensively. Conversely, responses with high helpfulness but low safety scores can be problematic, as they might engage users with more relevant or detailed information but risk breaching ethical or safe communication standards. Optimal AI performance is likely achieved through a balance where both scores are maximized, ensuring responses are both useful and secure."

Initially, the AI should emphasize the importance of following legal guidelines and explicitly refuse to support illegal activities.

Moreover, encouraging the user to modify their query into a safer and legally compliant form can foster a constructive interaction while upholding ethical standards."

67","In the helpfulness dataset, as the safety data percentage increases from 0 to 6, there is a corresponding incremental growth in false refusal rates from approximately 0.006% to 0.05%. Conversely, in the borderline dataset, a similar increase in safety data from 16 to 27 percentage points results in a rise in false refusal rates from 15% to 27%. This illustrates that the false refusal rates are much higher and increase more steeply in datasets concerning more sensitive or borderline topics compared to more benign or helpful content."

67","The book presents various scenarios involving illicit activities such as dealing with fake IDs, use of dynamite in construction, bypassing car security systems, and tax evasion. These examples highlight the critical nature of evaluating AI systems adequately to ensure they do not inadvertently provide advice or participate in harmful, illegal, or unethical activities. This underscores the importance of implementing robust safety measures to prevent AI from engaging in or encouraging negative behaviors as demonstrated by the false refusal rate trends in different datasets."

They assess the truthfulness by checking if the model's responses are fact-based and make sense in light of common knowledge. For toxicity, they verify that the language used by the models does not include harmful or hateful speech directed towards any group. Finally, they look into the model-generated responses to evaluate any slant or unfair bias towards any demographic, assessing whether the sentiments expressed are negative, positive, or neutral."

we selected are representative of our understanding that Llama 2-Chat improves on critical aspects of LLM
safety. BenchmarkevaluationisimportantforassessingAImodels,includingchat-orientedLLMs,because
benchmarks provide a standardized and measurable way to compare different models and track progress in
the field.

70","The main concern with employing standard benchmarks for evaluating the safety of chat-oriented language learning models (LLMs) lies in their inability to completely encompass the scope of toxicity and bias. These benchmarks often fail to address specific adversarial inputs or toxic content that specifically targets the model’s vulnerabilities, and they may not include all demographic categories, thus providing a somewhat limited view on model safety."

example, we ask that prompts they write do not:
1. Promote or enable criminal activities.
2. Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.
3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.

for conciseness.
76","Model contamination affects various contamination levels differently, indicating different degrees of sensitivity or resilience among the subsets. For example, subsets labeled as 'Not Clean' generally show higher average performance values, potentially benefiting from contamination due to more frequent or significant sequence matches within the training data. Statistically, results are assessed using the Zn statistic, which measures the standard deviations away from the mean performance of uncontaminated samples. A Zn value exceeding |2| is considered significant, suggesting that the performance deviation within that subset is likely due to the contamination effect rather than random chance, as seen prominently in the 70B model analyses across 'Not Clean' and 'Dirty' types."

Overview Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available
sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as
wellasoveronemillionnewhuman-annotatedexamples. Neitherthepretraining
nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.
Data Freshness The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is
more recent, up to July 2023.
Evaluation Results
See evaluations for pretraining (Section 2); fine-tuning (Section 3); and safety (Section 4).
Ethical Considerations and Limitations (Section 5.2)
Llama 2 is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in
English, and has notcovered, nor could it coverall scenarios. For these reasons, aswith all LLMs,
Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances
produceinaccurateorobjectionableresponsestouserprompts. Therefore,beforedeployingany
applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their
specific applications of the model. Please see the Responsible Use Guide available available at
https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-user-guide
Table 52: Model card for Llama 2 .
77","Llama 2 is available in three distinct parameter sizes which include 7B, 13B, and 70B. Each size caters to varying computational needs and application scales, providing options for both smaller-scale and larger, more complex deployments. In addition to parameter sizes, Llama 2 offers models that are either pretrained or fine-tuned. The pretrained models are adaptable for various natural language generation tasks, while fine-tuned models are tailored for more specific uses such as assistant-like interactions, ensuring efficacy in targeted scenarios."
